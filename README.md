# The Movie Quiz
The project is a quiz application that tests users' knowledge of movies. The app is built using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. React Native allows the app to be deployed on both iOS and Android devices. The app has a minimal user interface (UI) to make it easy and straightforward for users to navigate and use.

The quiz application contains multiple-choice questions related to movies, and users can select an answer from a list of choices. The questions are randomized, so each quiz is unique, and the app can test users on a wide variety of movie-related knowledge. The app keeps track of users' scores, which they can view at the end of each quiz.

The application is deployed on Expo, a platform for building and deploying React Native applications. Expo provides an easy way to test and preview the app on a mobile device during development. It also simplifies the deployment process by handling the building and packaging of the app for both iOS and Android devices. This means that users can easily download and install the app on their mobile devices without the need for any additional software or tools.

Overall, this simple app provides an engaging and fun way for users to test their movie knowledge. Its minimal UI and cross-platform support make it accessible to a wide audience, and its deployment on Expo simplifies the process of building and distributing the app.
